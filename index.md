# A Present to You

I'm sorry we won't be here for your actual birthday. I wanted to find something I could easily give you as a preset while we are away. As well as something I thought might be unique and interesting to you. I bought you a few domain names cause I wasn't sure which one you would like, obviously [robotclowns.com](robotclowns.com), along with:

- robotclowns.art
- robotclowns.ink
- dancingplums.art
- dancingplums.ink

When I get home I can show you how to setup your own email so you can have west@robotclowns.com or whatever you want as well as how to update this website or point any of those other domains to this website. I can also show you how to completely revamp this to whatever you want. It could be a place to showcase your art, a place to sell merch, or even a place to just blog.

I think the world of you and I'm so proud of you. No matter what you do, where you go, who you become, I'm just so happy I get to be a part of it and I'll always be your biggest fan.
